# test_task

This is a test task in which I finished implementing the DocumentManager class.

The file itself is located in ```src/main/java/com/andre/DocumentManager.java```

It is also possible to test the functionality. There are 2 options:

1. Use tools the IDE of your choice. I used **IntelliJ** to complete the task.

Just go to ```src/test/java/com/andre/DocumentManagerTest.java```, right click on class and press run. Or choose individual
test method and run it. 

2. Through command line. Navigate to root directory (where pom.xml is located).\
When compling I used **Java version 21** and Maven configured to this version.

Open terminal and run:

```zsh
  mvn test
```
